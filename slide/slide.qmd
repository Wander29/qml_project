## Barren Plateaus

- random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states

- the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity ... on more than a few qubits

- For a wide class of PQCs, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits @McClean2018Nov
