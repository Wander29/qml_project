# Introduction

## Barren Plateaus

-  where the gradient of a cost function vanishes exponentially with system size, rendering the architecture untrainable for large problem sizes

- Random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states

- Due to exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity on more than a few qubits

-   For a wide class of PQCs, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits @McClean2018Nov

### Barren Plateaus on QCNNs

- The variance of the gradient vanishes no faster than polynomially @Pesah2021Oct so QCNNs do not exhibit _barren plateaus_. 

- It is guaranteed that randomly initialized QCNNs are trainable, unlike many other QNN architectures.
