This framework enables search space design and architecture search, the former being the most challenging point in applying NAS to QCNN.\nIn this work we generate the family of QCNN architectures resembling reverse binary trees and we evaluate this family on the GTZAN music genre classification dataset showing that it is possible to improve model performance without increasing complexity.",

    "text": "2.1 HierarQcal\nHierarQcal is an open-source python package5 that simplifies the process of creating general QCNN by enabling an hierarchical design process. It makes automatic generation of QCNN circuits easy and it facilitates QCNN search space design for NAS.\nThe package includes primitives such as convolutions, pooling and dense layers that can be stacked together hierarchically to form complex QCNN circuit architectures.",
